1. Snail and pole
	Snail creeps up the vertical pole of height H feets. Each day it goes A feets up, and each night it goes B feets down. 
	On which day will the snail reach the top of the pole?
	Input data format: On the input the program receives non-negative integers H, A, B, where H > B and A > B. 
	Every integer does not exceed 100.

	import java.util.Scanner;
	public class Main {
  	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		//put your code here
      		Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
        	int height = console.nextInt();
        	int dayProgress = console.nextInt();
        	int nightRegresss = console.nextInt();

        	int daysCount = 1; // at least one day
        	int totalProgress = 0;
        	// Snail can reach the top before night, so
        	while(true) {
            	totalProgress += dayProgress;
            	if(height - totalProgress <= 0) {
                	break;
            	}
            	totalProgress -= nightRegresss;
            	daysCount++;
        }
        System.out.println(daysCount);
  }
}


2. Queens in Chess
	Given coordinates of two queens on a chessboard, determine if they are attacking each other or not. 
	(A chess queen attacks in three ways: along its rank, in both directions; along its file, in both directions, 
	and diagonally in all four directions.)

	Input data format
	User inputs two pairs of integer coordinates: x1, y1, x2, y2, all in the interval [1,8].

	Output data format
	Type "YES" (uppercase) if the two queens are attacking each other, or "NO" if they don't.

	Hint: You may need to use the following method, which calculates the absolute value of a number:
	Math.abs(n)

	solution:
	import java.util.Scanner;
	import java.math.*;
	public class Main {

  	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		//put your code here
      		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
      
      		//point for queen1
	        int x1 = scanner.nextInt();
      		int y1 = scanner.nextInt();
      
      		//point for queen2
      		int x2 = scanner.nextInt();
      		int y2 = scanner.nextInt();
      
      		// x is rank, y is file
      		if ((x1 == x2) || (y1 == y2) || (Math.abs(x1 - x2) == Math.abs(y1 - y2))) {
			// vertical and horizontal => (x1 == x2) || (y1 == y2)
			// any diagonal => (Math.abs(x1 - x2) == Math.abs(y1 - y2))
          		System.out.println("YES"); 
      		} else {
          		System.out.println("NO");
      		}
  	}
	}



3. Chocolate bar
	A chocolate bar has a rectangular shape, divided into NxM segments. You can break down this chocolate bar into two parts by a 
	single straight line (only once). Determine if you can break off exactly K segments of chocolate. (Each segment is 1x1.).
	Input data format:
	User inputs three integers: N, M, K.
	Output data format:
	The program must output one of the two words: YES or NO.

	import java.util.Scanner;
	public class Main {
  		public static void main(String[] args) {
    			Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    			int rows = scanner.nextInt();
    			int columns = scanner.nextInt();
    			int segments = scanner.nextInt();

			// We need the segments to be divisible either by the rows or the columns 
			// and also amount of segments (K) can't be greater then total amount of segments (NxM)
    			if ((segments % rows == 0 || segments % columns == 0) && columns * rows > segments){
      				System.out.println("YES");
    			} else {
      				System.out.println("NO");
    			}
  		}
	}
